## Parsons Problems

Study many different ways to approach the same problem by reconstructing different solutions. The exercises in this folder are organized like so:

- **one folder per behavior**: The top-level folders all contain solutions to the same coding challenge
  - **one folder per strategy**: Folders inside each coding challenge have a different strategy
    - **one .js file per implementation**: Each parsons problem has a different implementation for the same strategy
