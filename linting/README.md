# Linting

These exercises each focus on one important rule from the ESLint configuration in this repository. You have some code that works, but hase a bad practice.

Using the feedback from the `[eslint]` button see if you can rewrite the code to behave the same, without having any linting errors.

---

There are many more rules! You can read about them all at [eslint.org/docs/rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules), and you can try them all out at [eslint.org/demo](https://eslint.org/demo).

To see (some of) the configuration for this this repository check out [../.eslintrc.json](../.eslintrc.json?highlight)
